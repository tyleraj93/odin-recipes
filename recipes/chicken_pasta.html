<ul>
    <li>10 ounces boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano, undrained</li>
    <li>1 cup Swanson® Chicken Broth</li>
    <li>4 ounces uncooked penne pasta</li>
    <li>¾ cup water</li>
    <li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Season the chicken as desired. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until
    well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet.</li>
    <li>Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and heat to a boil,
    stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomatoes, Swanson Chicken Broth, penne, and water; heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 10
    minutes or until the penne is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or
    until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the spinach and cook for 1 minute or until the spinach is wilted.</li>
